## How to Run This Project

This project is designed to run inside a development container with Docker CLI pre-installed. Follow the steps below to set up and run the project:

### Prerequisites
1. Ensure you have Docker installed on your host machine.
2. Install a development environment that supports dev containers, such as Visual Studio Code with the Remote - Containers extension.

### Steps to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository:
  ```bash
  git clone <repository-url>
  cd <repository-folder>
  ```

2. Open the project in Visual Studio Code.

3. Reopen the project in the dev container:
  - Press `F1` in Visual Studio Code.
  - Select `Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container`.

4. Once the dev container is built and running, use the Docker CLI (pre-installed in the container) to manage and run the project.

5. To start the application, run the following command inside the dev container:
  ```bash
  cd resources
  docker-compose up
  ```
  - This command will start the Localstack container, containing several AWS services, including DynamoDB, S3, and Lambda
  - The Localstack container will be accessible at `http://localhost:4566`.
  - Alongside with Localstack, the container runs a DynamoDb local admin page, which can be accessed at `http://localhost:8007`.

6. Access the application in your browser or via the specified endpoint.

### Additional Notes
- The dev container includes a dedicated Docker daemon, so all Docker commands will run within the container environment.
- Refer to the `docker-compose.yml` file for service configurations and ports.
